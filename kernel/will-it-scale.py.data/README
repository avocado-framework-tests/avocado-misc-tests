Will It Scale takes a testcase and runs it from 1 through to n parallel copies
to see if the testcase will scale. It builds both a process and threads based
test in order to see any differences between the two.

Following is a list of testcase currently supported.

 - brk1
 - brk2
 - context_switch1
 - dup1
 - eventfd1
 - fallocate1
 - fallocate2
 - futex1
 - futex2
 - futex3
 - futex4
 - getppid1
 - lock1
 - lock2
 - lseek1
 - lseek2
 - malloc1
 - malloc2
 - mmap1
 - mmap2
 - open1
 - open2
 - open3
 - page_fault1
 - page_fault2
 - page_fault3
 - pipe1
 - poll1
 - poll2
 - posix_semaphore1
 - pread1
 - pread2
 - pread3
 - pthread_mutex1
 - pthread_mutex2
 - pthread_mutex3
 - pthread_mutex4
 - pthread_mutex5
 - pwrite1
 - pwrite2
 - pwrite3
 - read1
 - read2
 - read3
 - read4
 - readseek1
 - readseek2

A yaml file included with this test case allows a user to invoke one or many
testcases. Each testcase can take upto an hour or so depending on amount of
resources available on the system under test. runalltests will invoke all the
tests and can take a very long time(to the order of day) to complete.
runtest.py can be used to run individual tests

To run a specific test use following stanza in yaml:
postprocess: True
testcase: !mux
    brk1:
        name: brk1

To run all tests use following stanza:
postprocess: True
testcase: !mux
    All:
        name: All

Individual .csv and .html result files are copied to log directory.

This test requires
 - more than one NUMA node
 - python 3.7+
 - hwloc binaries & libraries

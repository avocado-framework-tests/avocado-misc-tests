The lvm setup checks whether the provided volume group exists. If not,
creates one from the ramdisk. It then creates a logical volume if there
is no logical volume with given name. Takes a snapshot from the logical
volume and merges snapshot with the logical volume.

Inputs Needed in yaml file:
---------------------------
disks: Name of the disks on which volume groups, logical volumes,
      snapshots are created. Created on loop device if not specified
vg_name: Name of the volume group.
lv_name: Name of the logical volume.
lv_size: Size of the logical volume as string in the form "#G"
         (for example 30G).
ramdisk_vg_size: Size of the physical volume to be created.
ramdisk_basedir: Base directory to place the sparse file
ramdisk_sparse_filename: Name of the sparse file.
lv_snapshot_name: Name of the snapshot with origin the logical
                  volume.
lv_snapshot_size: Size of the snapshot with origin the logical
                  volume also as "#G".

A tool to monitor I/O latency in real time. It shows disk latency in the same way as ping shows network latency.

Inputs Needed in yaml file:
---------------------------
count - stop ioping after <count> requests
deadline - stop ioping after <deadline> requests
period - print raw statistics for every <period> requests
interval - interval between requests in seconds
size - Request size (4k)
wsize - Working set size (1m for directory, whole size for file or device)
disk - path for the disk (ex: /dev/mapper/mpathd)

Usage: ioping [-LABCDWRq] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-pP period] [-i interval]
               [-s size] [-S wsize] [-o offset] directory|file|device
        ioping -h | -v

      -c <count>      stop after <count> requests
      -w <deadline>   stop after <deadline>
      -p <period>     print raw statistics for every <period> requests
      -P <period>     print raw statistics for every <period> in time
      -i <interval>   interval between requests (1s)
      -s <size>       request size (4k)
      -S <wsize>      working set size (1m)
      -o <offset>     working set offset (0)
      -k              keep and reuse temporary working file
      -L              use sequential operations (includes -s 256k)
      -A              use asynchronous I/O
      -C              use cached I/O
      -D              use direct I/O
      -W              use write I/O *DANGEROUS*
      -R              seek rate test (same as -q -i 0 -w 3 -S 64m)
      -B              print final statistics in raw format
      -q              suppress human-readable output
      -h              display this message and exit
      -v              display version and exit

EXAMPLES

ioping .
    Show disk I/O latency using the default values and the current directory, until interrupted
    This command prepares temporary (unlinked/hidden) working file and reads random chunks from it using non-cached read requests 
ioping -c 10 -s 1M /tmp
    Measure latency on /tmp using 10 requests of 1 megabyte each 
ioping -R /dev/sda
    Measure disk seek rate
ioping -RL /dev/sda
    Measure disk sequential speed
ioping -RLB . | awk '{print $4}'
    Get disk sequential speed in bytes per second

Install Paramiko module:
Ubuntu :
-> apt-get install python-paramiko
-SLES/RHEL :
SLES :

-> SLES: Install python-devel,python-setuptools
--> RHEL: Install python-devel.ppc64le and python-setuptools.noarch
-> Download pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz & paramiko-1.16.0.tar.gz
-> For pycrypto : python setup.py build & python setup.py install
-> For parmaiko : easy_install ./
-> Then import paramiko.

Explanation of the input parameters for single vnic:
hmc_pwd ---> HMC password
hmc_username ---> HMC user name
manageSystem --> Provide the HMC manage system name of the CEC
vios_ip ---> ip of vios for vios failover
vios_username ---> vios user name
vios_pwd---> vios password
slot_num ---> slot number on which the Network virtualized interface will be added. Should be 3 - 2999 and unused currently. space separated for more
vios_names ---> space separated name of the vios used to add/remove Network virtualized interface
sriov_adapters ---> space separated location code (DRC) of the the adapters that is assigned to the hypervisor
sriov_ports ---> space separated ports using which the Network virtualized interface will be added/removed
Ex: if the adapter has 2 ports and the Network virtualized interface should be added using Port 1, mention value as 0
else mention 2 if Network virtualized interface should be added using Port 1
bandwidth ---> The percentage of the ports bandwidth this Network virtualized interface is entitled to, space separated for more
priority ---> space separated prirotiy value for backing devices should be range of 1-100 (1,100,50,.. 1 for active and 100, 50 for consecutive backing device). 1 represents highest priority, 100 represents lowest, 50 is default if param not specified
auto_failover --> enable auto_failover flag, 1 to enable or 0 to disable, defaults to 1
device_ip ---> Ip to be configured for the added Network virtualized interface, space separated if multiple
netmask ---> netmask value for the added Network virtualized interface, space separated if multiple
peer_ip ---> Peer ip to which the added Network virtualized interface will ping to check for ping test
count ---> The number of times the failover test has to be executed
num_of_dlpar --> number of times ddlpar remove and add operation to be executed
mac_id ---> MAC ID to be set for the vnic interface. This is needed for us to have control over interface name via interface file or udev rules, space separated if multiple
host_public_ip ---> Public IP of the host
host_password ---> Login password for the host machine 
user_name ---> Host user name 

Explanation of the input parameters for multiple vnic:
hmc_pwd ---> HMC password
hmc_username ---> HMC user name
slot_num ---> multiple slot number separated with space, on which the Network virtualized interface will be added. Should be 3 - 2999 and unused currently. space separated for more
vios_names ---> space separated name of the vios used to add/remove Network virtualized interface
sriov_adapters ---> space separated location code (DRC) of the the adapters that is assigned to the hypervisor.
if want multiple Network virtualized interface from same adapter, ex : "U78D5.ND1.CSS130E-P1-C4-C1 U78D5.ND1.CSS130E-P1-C4-C1"
if want multiple Network virtualized interface from different adapter, ex : "U78D5.ND1.CSS130E-P1-C4-C1 U78D5.ND2.CSS140C-P1-C5-C1"
sriov_ports ---> space separated ports using which the Network virtualized interface will be added/removed
priority: space separated prirotiy value for backing devices should be range of 1-100 (1,100,50,.. 1 for active and 100, 50 for consecutive backing device). 1 represents highest priority, 100 represents lowest, 50 is default if param not specified
auto_failover ---> enable auto_failover flag, 1 to enable or 0 to disable, defaults to 1
bandwidth ---> The percentage of the ports bandwidth this Network virtualized interface is entitled to, space separated for more
device_ip ---> space separated ip address
netmasks ---> space separated netmask
peer_ip ---> space separated peer ip
mac_id ---> MAC ID to be set for the vnic interface. This is needed for us to have control over interface name via interface file or udev rules, space separated mac id
user_name ---> host user name 
host_public_ip ---> public IP of the host, required to copy the eeh_tool to vios 
host_password ---> Login password of the host, required to copy the eeh_tool to vios 

NOTE: all failover test will not execute when it will create multiple Network virtualized interface.
and for now multiple Network virtualized interface with multiple backing device will not work.

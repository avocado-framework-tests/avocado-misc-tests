#### This README.md file details on how to configure system to run dlpar cpu/memory tests ####
# Ensure LPARs are installed with dlpar packages for respective Distros(Ex: RHEL and SLES) #
# Path to install dlpar packages:
- https://ausgsa.ibm.com/projects/p/poweryum/yum/OSS/
OR
- https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/yum/OSS/
#
# Ensure, lpars are capable of dlpar operationis i.e, CPU, MEMORY Dlpar capable and RMC state is active
# Run below command on HMC and check: 
# lssyscfg -r lpar -m <managed system name> -F lpar_id,name,rmc_state,dlpar_mem_capable,dlpar_proc_capable,dlpar_io_capable
#
# HowTo run tests from avocado:
# avocado run --test-runner runner dlpar_main.py -m <path for lpar.yaml>
#
# This test require 2 LPARs to run dlpar cpu, memory operations namely add/remove/move.
# All the test configuration needs to be filled in dlpar_main.py.data/dlpar.yaml
#
# Sample dlpar.yaml is provided as below:
#cat dlpar_main.py.data/dlpar.yaml

#Usage:
#./testscript - A simple bash script for running all the test cases
#./pi - A simple program for statistically calculating pi
#./rw - A simple i/o bound example program.
#./pi-sched - A simple program for statistically calculating pi using
#             a specific scheduling policy
#./rw-sched - A simple program that reads and writes to an I/0 device using
#             a specific scheduling policy
#./pi-rw-sched - A simple program that combines the previous two programs
#./driver - A program that forks processes to run multiple of the above programs
#           at the same time with different scheduling processses

Description:
-------------
    - The main purpose of this test aims at stressing the memory component of
      the target system, using the memory stressors through the stress-ng
      program.
    - The script also imposes a load on the CPU, but that's just a side-effect
    - The script uses a total of 28 stressors out of which we have 22 constant
      runtime stressors and 6 variable runtime stressors.

Input Parameters:
------------------
    --base_time    : 
        - Specifies the time (in seconds) to run each stressor
        - Deafult is 300 seconds or 5 minutes.

    --time_per_gig :
        - This specifies the time (in seconds) given to SOME stressors per GB
        - Default is 60 seconds or 1 minute.
        - 10 seconds per stressor, a total of 6 stressors hence;
          [10 x 6] = 60s per GiB

How is the estimated execution time calculated?
-------------------------------------------------
    - Considering the defaults the Calculations are as below : 

    A] : For parameter --base-time       :   [ 28 x 300 ] 
                                            = [8400 seconds] OR [140 minutes]

    B] : For parameter --time-per-gig    :   ([16gb x 60s] / 60)
                                            = 16 minutes
                             OR
                                            ([32gb x 60s] / 60)
                                            = 32 minutes
    Total Time taken = [A + B]
                     = [140 + 16]
                     = [156] minutes for a 16gb machine
             OR
                     = [140 + 32]
                     = [172] minutes for a 32gb machine
Method descriptions:
----------------------
    def execute_stressor():
    - This method runs individual stressors - one at a time.
    - Inputs : stressor, runtime
    - Output : The variable "had_error" is set to value 1 in case of an error.

    def calculate_variable_time()
    - This method will estimate the time required for running the constant
      runtime stressors & the variable runtime stressors.
    - The calculations required for these estimates are explained above in
      the "How is the estimated execution time calculated?" section.

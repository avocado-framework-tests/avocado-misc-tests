Test Usage:

./mem_integrity_test -s <scenario_number>

The test basically contains 3 test scenario's:

Scanerio 1:
The test maps 80% of memory and writes a pattern into it and verifies whether the same 
pattern is read again. It also verifies whether all pages faulted and has pfn or not.


Scenario 2:
It determines two nodes which contains atleast 10% of total memory and allocate
pages in node1 and writes pattern into it. Then, the pages are moved to node2,
pattern is read and verified from node2. It also verifies whether all pages 
are faulted in the corresponding node requested else test is failed.

The test fails if numa suport is not there or if two nodes does not contains 
at least 10% of total system memory.

Scenario 3:
The test maps 10% of memory and writes a pattern into it and it does soft offline of 
that memory.Read from the same address again which is expected to be faulted from
some other portion of memory.

Note that the percentage of memory soft-offlined is considered as bad area and taken out 
of normal memory management. System must be rebooted to make use of full memory of the 
system again.

    tbench produces only the TCP and process load. It does the same socket
    calls that smbd would do under a netbench load. It does no filesystem
    calls. The idea behind tbench is to eliminate smbd from the netbench
    test, as though the smbd code could be made infinitely fast. The
    throughput results of tbench tell us how fast a netbench run could go
    if we eliminated all filesystem IO and SMB packet processing.tbench
    is built as part of the dbench package.
